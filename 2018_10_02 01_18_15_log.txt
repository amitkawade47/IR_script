Any filename can be given as `-', meaning stdin or stdout.
PARAMETERASSIGNMENT is one or more expressions like `name=value' (without spaces!). One value without name defaults to `F`, two values defaults to `D` and `F`, three values defaults to `D`, `S`, and `F`, four values to `D`, `S`, `F', and `T`, in the order given.

All integer values are nonnegative and can be given in base 10, 16 (prefix `0x'), 8 (leading 0), or 2 (prefix `0b' or `%'). They must be less or equal to 2^63-1 = 9223372036854775807.

All parameter assignment, both with explicit name and without, can be given as intervals, like `0..255' or '0:255', causing the program to generate all signals within the interval. Also * can be used for parameter intervals, in which case min and max are taken from the parameterspecs in the (extended) IRP notation. The notation #<number> can also be used for parameter intervals, in which case <number> random values between min and max are generated.

Any filename can be given as `-', meaning stdin or stdout.
PARAMETERASSIGNMENT is one or more expressions like `name=value' (without spaces!). One value without name defaults to `F`, two values defaults to `D` and `F`, three values defaults to `D`, `S`, and `F`, four values to `D`, `S`, `F', and `T`, in the order given.

All integer values are nonnegative and can be given in base 10, 16 (prefix `0x'), 8 (leading 0), or 2 (prefix `0b' or `%'). They must be less or equal to 2^63-1 = 9223372036854775807.

All parameter assignment, both with explicit name and without, can be given as intervals, like `0..255' or '0:255', causing the program to generate all signals within the interval. Also * can be used for parameter intervals, in which case min and max are taken from the parameterspecs in the (extended) IRP notation. The notation #<number> can also be used for parameter intervals, in which case <number> random values between min and max are generated.

PARAMETERASSIGNMENT is one or more expressions like `name=value' (without spaces!). One value without name defaults to `F`, two values defaults to `D` and `F`, three values defaults to `D`, `S`, and `F`, four values to `D`, `S`, `F', and `T`, in the order given.

All parameter assignment, both with explicit name and without, can be given as intervals, like `0..255' or '0:255', causing the program to generate all signals within the interval. Also * can be used for parameter intervals, in which case min and max are taken from the parameterspecs in the (extended) IRP notation.
